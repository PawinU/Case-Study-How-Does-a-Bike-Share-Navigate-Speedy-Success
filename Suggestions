The company should provide a different kind of membership plan that attracts more customer that wants to use the bike in a short period. The limit of subscriber riders is 45 minutes. The average ride length of the subscriber rider is only 13.8 minutes. On the other hand, the average ride length of the casual rider is 31.2 minutes. 

The membership plan required the customer to pay $108 upfront. These could be an issue for a customer that earns money daily such as student and daily wage. Therefore, the company can provide a short-term subscription plan for those customers who can effort to pay the current fee.

The companyâ€™s marketing strategy should encourage customers to use the docked bike. Usage of docked bikes is very low in both types of customers.
